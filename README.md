## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

One important thing I learnt is that you cannot add an overflow property on an absolutely displayed element unless the parent container has relative positioning. Who knew? ðŸ˜‚

### Continued development

Although this project has probably the best mobile menu I've ever built, there's still abit to improve on in the realm of mobile menus for me.
